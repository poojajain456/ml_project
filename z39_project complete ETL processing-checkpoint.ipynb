    "\n",
    "A Web Data ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline is a systematic process used in data engineering to collect, transform, and load data from various sources on the internet into a structured and usable format for analysis and storage. It is essential for managing and processing large volumes of data gathered from websites, online platforms, and digital sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "The process begins with data extraction, where relevant information is collected from websites, APIs, databases, and other online sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then this raw data is transformed through various operations, including cleaning, filtering, structuring, and aggregating. After transformation, the data is loaded into a CSV file or database, making it accessible for further analysis, reporting, and decision-making"
